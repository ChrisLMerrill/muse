# Muse test framework



Muse is a framework for visually building and running automated website tests with the goal of maximizing productivity and maintainability while minizing coding requirements. Test scripts are created as data (rather than code) that can be easily manipulated by other tools, such as the MuseIDE. It is designed to provide the flexibility, extensibility and maintainability that is frequently missing from high-level test development tools.

The MuseIDE provides an intuitive and productive UI for building, debugging and updating tests built for the Muse Test Framework

See the Muse wiki for more documentation: https://github.com/ChrisLMerrill/muse/wiki

There is a project containing example tests you can try running with the framework: https://github.com/ChrisLMerrill/muse-examples

Binary distribution of this project, the examples and the MuseIDE are available from: http://ide4selenium.com/#/download
