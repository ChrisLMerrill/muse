# Muse task framework



Muse is a framework for visually building and running automated tasks with the goal of maximizing productivity and maintainability while minizing coding requirements. Tasks are created as data (rather than code) that can be easily manipulated by other tools, such as the MuseIDE. It is designed to provide the flexibility, extensibility and maintainability that is frequently missing from high-level automation development tools. Automated testing of web applications (using Selenium/WebDrvier) One of the primary use-cases that the frameowkr was designed for.

See the Muse wiki for more documentation: https://github.com/ChrisLMerrill/muse/wiki

There is a project containing example tasks you can try running with the framework: https://github.com/ChrisLMerrill/muse-examples

The MuseIDE (http://ide4selenium.com/) provides an intuitive and productive UI for building, debugging and updating automation tasks to be run by the Muse Test Framework

Binary distribution of this project, the examples and the MuseIDE are available from: http://ide4selenium.com/#/download
